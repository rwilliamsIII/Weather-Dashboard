About the App: This is a weather dashboard created so that users can look up current day weather as well as get a five day forecast. Everytime a user searches a city it is saved on the screen so that they can go back later and view previously searched cities. When opened a user should see any previously searched cities from their machine as well as a blank form to search for a new city.
